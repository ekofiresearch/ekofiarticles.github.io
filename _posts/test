Groundbreaking technology can improve the study of vascular diseases such as diabetes
Scientists for the first time in a petri dish organocytes as excellent human blood vessels were able to grow.

The breakthrough engineering technology, outlined in a recent study published in Nature today, dramatically improves the exploration of vascular diseases such as diabetes, identifying it as a key way to potentially prevent changes in blood vessels - the main cause of death and disease among people with diabetes.

A organoid is a three-dimensional structure that grows from stem cells that mimic an organ and can be used to study the properties of this organ in a petri dish.

Josef Penninger, director of the UBC Institute of Life Sciences and co-director of the Institute's founding director, Functional Genetic Research Chief, Canada, leri A game changer to build human blood vessels as organoids from stem cells BC

Daki Every organ in our body is associated with the circulatory system. This may help researchers to solve the causes and treatments of various vascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases, wound healing problems, stroke, cancer and of course diabetes. Bu

Diabetes affects approximately 420 million people worldwide. Most of the diabetic symptoms lead to changes in blood vessels, impaired blood circulation, and oxygen supply to the tissues. Despite its prevalence, little is known about vascular changes due to diabetes. This limitation has slowed the development of much-needed treatment.

To solve this problem, Penninger and his colleagues developed a groundbreaking model: the three-dimensional human blood vessel organoids grown in a petri dish. These de vascular organoids insan can be planted using stem cells in the laboratory and dramatically mimics the structure and function of real human blood vessels.

When the researchers transferred blood vessel organoids to the mice, they discovered that they became excellent functional human blood vessels, including arteries and capillaries. This discovery shows that it is possible to grow not only blood vessel organocytes from human stem cells in a container, but also a functional human vascular system of another type.

Am What's exciting about our work is that we've been successful in removing real human blood vessels from stem cells, gerçek said Reiner Wimmer, the first author and post-doctoral research fellow at the IMBA. ”Our organoids are substantially similar to human capillaries, even at the molecular level, and now we can use them to study blood vessel diseases directly in human tissue.“

One feature of diabetes is that the blood vessels show abnormal thickening of the basal membrane. Consequently, delivery of oxygen and nutrients to cells and tissues is severely impaired and causes a number of health problems leading to amputations such as renal failure, heart attack, stroke, blindness and peripheral artery disease.
