1 - Don't panic and think.
--
What can I do? Just relax and think before electric comes.

You can (maybe :/) beat electric power.
                                                                                              
3 - Keep the electrical sources away from the very cold and away from the very hot.
--
Sources may explode at high temperatures.
                                                         
The yield of resources may decrease from cold /or/ may not work.
Also, electric vehicles are less efficient in cold weather.
                                                                                     
4 - Be careful not to allow steam to come out of the plugs and sockets.
--
Especially when children are handicapped, it can have bad consequences. It can also cause a very large explosion.
                                                                                                                   
5 - A Deadly Shower: Do not enter the shower in the thunderstorm.
--
Metal is a good conductor, so if lightning strikes an unprotected house, chances are the current will travel through any metal pipes. 
So basically, being wet can make the difference between an unpleasant electrical shock and a deadly one.
