title: "Prince Rupert's drops are toughened glass beads created by dripping molten glass into cold water"
---
The drops of Prince Rupert are produced by dropping melted glass drops into cold water. Water quickly cools and solidifies the glass from the outside. This thermal quenching can be explained using a simplified model of a fast chilled sphere. The drop of Prince Rupert has remained a scientific curiosity for about 400 years, due to two unusual mechanical properties - when the tail is cut, the drop bursts into the powder, while the bulbous head can withstand up to 15,000 newtons (3,400 lbf).

These droplets are characterized internally by very high residual stresses, which give rise to counter-intuitive properties, such as the ability to withstand a blow from (e.g. a hammer) on the bulbous end without breaking, while exhibiting explosive disintegration if the tail end is even slightly damaged. In nature, similar structures are produced under certain conditions in volcanic lava and are known as Pele's tears.

Prince Rupert's drops are produced by dropping molten glass drops into cold water. The water rapidly cools and solidifies the glass from the outside inward. This thermal quenching may be described using a simplified model of a rapidly cooled sphere. Prince Rupert's drops have remained a scientific curiosity for nearly 400 years due to two unusual mechanical properties — when the tail is snipped, the drop disintegrates explosively into powder, whereas the bulbous head can withstand compressive forces of up to 15,000 newtons (3,400 lbf).

The explosive disintegration arises due to multiple crack bifurcation events when the tail is cut — a single crack is accelerated in the tensile residual stress field in the center of the tail and bifurcates after it reaches a critical velocity of 1,450–1,900 metres per second (3,200–4,300 mph). Given these high speeds, the disintegration process due to crack bifurcation can only be inferred by looking into the tail and employing high speed imaging techniques. This is perhaps why this curious property of the drops remained unexplained for centuries.

The second unusual property of the drops, namely the strength of the heads, is a direct consequence of large compressive residual stresses—up to 700 megapascals (100,000 psi)—that exist in the vicinity of the head's outer surface. This stress distribution is measured by using glass's natural property of stress-induced birefringence and by employing techniques of 3D photoelasticity. The high fracture toughness due to residual compressive stresses makes Prince Rupert's drops one of the earliest examples of toughened glass.

In a Prince Rupert's drop, the interface between the inner and outer regions deflects the forces sideways, so the crack can't propagate. Also, if the tail is broken, the shallow cracks in the tail shoot parallel to the axis of the drop, deep into the head, and into the interface. The damage is so great and causes an explode.

"The tensile stress is what usually causes materials to fracture analogous to tearing a sheet of paper in half," says Purdue postdoctoral associate Koushik Viswanathan. "But if you could change the tensile stress to a compressive stress, then it becomes difficult for cracks to grow, and this is what happens in the head portion of the Prince Rupert's drops."
