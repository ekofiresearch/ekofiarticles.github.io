The endangered tiger DNA was sent into space as a substitute - Dry DNA powder from a South Chinese tiger of the Guangzhou Zoo was sprayed into space by the Long 11th March carrier rocket on Saturday for the reserve storage of genes of these endangered species.

Dry DNA powder obtained from a South Chinese tiger in the Guangzhou Zoo was launched into the space on March 11 with the Long 11th March carrier rocket for the storage of genes of these endangered species.

According to the zoo in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, the DNA launched in the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China comes from the blood of a male South Chinese tiger, Kang Kang.

It is now in orbit about 1000 kilometers away from the ground and at low temperature.

This helps to prevent the risk of losing species resources and can ensure the latest protection of the original gene data of species on earth and protect them from human impact.

South Chinese Tiger

This time, in partnership with Endless Door, an aviation technology company in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and developed joint containers for dried DNA powder in conjunction with the Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology in China.

The container is designed to provide protection against space radiation and sudden high temperatures.

Previous studies have successfully proven that human and animal gene samples can be obtained in orbit.
