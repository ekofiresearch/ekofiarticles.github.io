The mysterious hum that is heard all over the world

Hum, known as a strong, gripping voice in different places, is known around here; Bristol, England; and Largs, Scotland.

But what Hum has caused and why it only affects a small percentage of the population in certain regions remains a mystery, despite some scientific research.

The reports began circulating in the 1950s from people who had never seen anything unusual before; Suddenly annoying, low-frequency, trembling, roaring, or rumbling.

The common points of the cases seem to have several factors: Hum is usually heard only indoors and heard louder than at night. It is also more common in rural or suburban areas; Humus reports are rare in urban areas, probably due to the dark background noise in crowded cities.

Who can hear Hum?
According to a 2003 study by Geoff Leventall, an acoustical consultant in Surrey, England, only about 2 percent of people who live in any Hum-prone area hear the voice, most of them between 55 and 70 years of age.

Most people who hear Hum (sometimes referred to as "listeners" or "hummers") describe the sound in a similar manner to a diesel engine that is recently idling. And Hum drove almost every one to despair.

"This is a kind of torture and sometimes we want to scream," retired Katie Jacques of Leeds, England, told the BBC. Leeds is one of several places the UK has seen recently.

"Night is the worst," Jacques said. "It's hard to get out of sleep because I hear this throbbing voice on the backplane"

Doctors complain of headache, nausea, dizziness, nasal obstruction and sleep disturbances. At least one suicide in England is accused on Hum, according to BBC reports.

Hum regions
Bristol, England, was one of the first places on Earth to report Hum. In the 1970s, about 800 people on the shore reported that they had heard the constant tremor blamed on vehicles and 24 hours shifts from local factories.

Another famous hum, Taos, has come to fruition near the United States. Beginning in the spring of 1991, people living in the region complained of a low-pitched noise. A group of researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory, University of New Mexico, Sandia National Laboratories and other regional specialists could not determine the source of the voice.

Another Hum hot spot in Windsor, Ontario. Researchers from Windsor University and Western University in Ontario, London, recently received a grant to analyze Windsor Hum and determine its cause.

The researchers have also been investigating Hum in Bondi, Australia's coastal region, Sydney for several years. "There are crazy people being sent here - the only thing you can do is stop the music broadcast, some leave the fans," a statement to a Daily Telegraph said.

There are speculations that hum can be a result of low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, which can be heard by some people. And there are cases where people have been confirmed to have certain sensitivities to signals outside of their normal hearing range.

Medical specialists note that earwigs (sound perception when no external impulse is present) are likely to be caused by a probable cause, but repeated tests have found that many audiences have normal hearing and no tinnitus.
