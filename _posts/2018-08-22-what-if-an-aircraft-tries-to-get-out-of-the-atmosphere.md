title: "What if an aircraft tries to get out of the atmosphere?"
---
We wondered what would happen to the plane coming out of the atmosphere.
There are even those who think even if we are close to the distance.

Well, what if it really tries to get out of an airplane?

As you approach the ceiling, the computer pilot begins to alert you. If the warning is ignored, one or both of the two things happens in short order:

- Motors that need atmospheric oxygen to work can not catch enough (or stop) enough to continue climbing, or they can catch a small chance.
- Wings and control surfaces will no longer have enough concept to lift and control the height of the aircraft.

In both cases the plane will land soon. If the engines are dead or losing power, the pilots should be able to restart APUs using power or air or using wind energy. If the aircraft is stopped, it may or may not be in control. Stalling aircraft falls to the first tail and while aircraft offer broad boundaries for altitude rescue, planes are not really intended to experience such end points. A tail-first passenger aircraft without engine power may not have sufficient hydraulic power to rescue and may not deploy auxiliary wind pumps. The computer can do odd things, and it's amazing how easy it is for people to fall in such times.

Probably, the crew will recover and descend unconsciously, but in both cases, they will probably have their last flight.


If an airplane tries to get out of the atmosphere, we'll give you the answer. Passengers can not leave the aircraft atmosphere.
This kind of plane crash or plane crash is rarely seen by computer. Only a fraction of the news of the plane crashes. The plane can not go out into the space without the atmosphere it needs. The pilot is blocking it.
